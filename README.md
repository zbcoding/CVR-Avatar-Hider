Untested mod for reference only, unless there's a feature to add in the future. ChilloutVR developers already added basic avatar hiding for far-away avatars in the base game.

# AvatarHider
This mod will automatically hide avatars based on the distance away from you.

Friend's avatars are ignored by default, but can be hidden by distance too if needed.

Created by zbcoding with code snippets from Dusks, replaceable, and based on the VRC AvatarHider mod from ImTiara & loukylor
